<p>The following is a narrative of him, who has been
justly styled “The Father of his Country.” It comprises
the first twenty-seven years of his life. Though
this is the least brilliant portion of Washington’s life,
it is a <em>valuable</em> portion of it; because it exhibits those
traits of character which laid the foundation of his future
greatness, and are worthy the attention and imitation
of youth.</p>

<p>The author, in remarking that he has drawn his information
from the most authentic sources, acknowledges
his obligations to the works of Weems, Ramsay, Marshall,

<p class="noi hang">Washington’s birth—his ancestors—the first school he
attended—family anecdotes—death of his father.</p>


<p class="p2">George Washington was born in Virginia,
on the 22d of February, 1732. The particular
place of his birth was Pope’s Creek,
Washington parish, in the county of Westmoreland.
The name of his great grandfather
was John Washington, who came
from the north of England and settled on
Pope’s Creek, in Virginia, in the year 1655.
He afterwards married Miss Pope, the daughter
of the gentleman from whom the Creek
took its name. John Washington is believed
to have been a military man in early
life. His will, now at Mount Vernon, is endorsed
thus: “The will of Lieutenant
Colonel Washington.” This will contains
a small bequest to the church, and affords
evidence that he was a pious man. As the
parish in which he lived has always borne
his name, he was probably very instrumental
in establishing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>John Washington had three children, Lawrence,
John and Ann. Lawrence Washington,
the oldest son and the grandfather of
George, inherited the Pope’s Creek farm.—Augustin
Washington, the son of Lawrence
and the father of George, was born in the
year 1694. He was probably the eldest son
of Lawrence, as he inherited the patrimonial
estate at Pope’s Creek.</p>

<p>Augustin Washington was married twice.
His first wife was Jane Butler, by whom he
had four children, viz. Butler, Lawrence,
Augustin, jun. and Jane. Butler and Jane
died young. Lawrence and Augustin lived
to be men. The second wife was Mary
Ball, a young lady of highly respectable
family in the northern part of Virginia.—George
was the first fruit of this union. He
was the oldest of six children, viz. George,
Elizabeth, Samuel, John Augustin, Charles
and Mildred. Mildred died very young.—George
was baptized April the 5th, 1732.</p>

<p>The church of England was then almost
the only denomination of Christians in the
colony of Virginia. The parents of George
Washington were members of this church,
and brought up their family in the habit of
regular attendance on public worship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The first school that George attended,
was kept by Mr. Hobby, an elderly man,
who was both the school master and the
sexton of the parish. By this old man, the
father of his country was first taught to read.
Although George’s father sent him to this
school, he took upon himself the oversight
of his education, and the pleasing duty of
early instilling into his mind the principles
of piety and virtue. His manner of doing
this appears by the following anecdotes,
which were related to the Rector of Mount
Vernon Parish, by a venerable lady now deceased,
who, as a friend and relative, spent
many of her youthful days in the family.</p>

<p>One fine morning in the autumn of 1737,
Mr. Washington, having George, then five
years old, by the hand, came to the door
and invited cousin Washington and myself
to walk with them to the orchard, promising
to show us a fine sight. On arriving at the
orchard, we were presented with a fine sight
indeed. The ground, as far as we could see,
was covered with mellow apples, and yet
the trees were bending under the weight of
their fruit. “George,” said his father,
“don’t you remember, my son, when this
good cousin of yours brought you that fine
large apple, last spring, that I could hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
prevail upon you to divide it with your
brothers and sisters? And don’t you remember
I then told you we ought to be
generous to each other because the Almighty
is so bountiful to us?” Poor George could
not say a word, but hanging down his head,
looked quite confused. “Now look around,
my son,” continued his father, “and see
how kindly the Almighty has treated us,
and learn from this how we ought to treat
our fellow creatures.” George looked a
while in silence on the abundance of fruit
before him, then lifting his eyes to his father,
he said, with emotion, “Well, father, only
forgive me this time, and see if I am ever so
stingy any more.”</p>

<p>Mr. Augustine Washington took great
pains early to inspire his son George with
the love of truth. The following anecdote
shows that his endeavors were not without
success.</p>

<p>When George was about six years old, he
became the owner of a hatchet, with which,
like most other little boys, he was very
much delighted. He went about chopping
every thing that came in his way. One
day, in the garden, he unluckily tried the
edge of his hatchet upon the body of a
beautiful young English cherry tree, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he cut so badly that the tree never recovered
from the injury. The next morning his
father seeing what had befallen the tree,
which, by the by, was a great favorite with
him, came into the house, and with much
warmth, asked who had done the mischief,
declaring at the same time, that he would
not have taken five guineas for the tree.—Nobody
could tell him any thing about it.
Presently George and his hatchet made their
appearance. “George,” said his father, “do
you know who cut that beautiful cherry
tree yonder in the garden?” George was
taken by surprise. He hesitated for a moment;
but he soon recovered himself.—Looking
at his father, he said, “I will not
tell a lie, father, I cut it with my hatchet.”
The delighted father, embracing his child,
said, “No matter about the tree, George;
you have frankly told me the truth. Though
you saw I was offended, you were not afraid
to do right. The pleasure I enjoy to witness
this noble conduct in my son is of more
value to me than a thousand such trees.”</p>

<p>Mr. Washington took the following method
to impress upon his son the existence and
wisdom of God from the evidence of design
in his works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>On a bed in the garden, well prepared for
the purpose, he traced with a stick the letters
of his son’s name. He then very carefully
sowed seed in the small furrows made by
the stick, covered it over and smoothed the
ground nicely with a roller. In a few days
the seed came up, and exhibited in large
letters, the words <span class="smcap">George Washington</span>.—They
soon caught the eye for which they
were intended. Again and again the astonished
boy read his name, springing up
from the earth, fresh and green. He ran to
his father and exclaimed, “O father! come
here! come with me and I will show you
such a sight as you never saw in all your
life.” Eagerly seizing his father’s hand, he
tugged him along through the garden to the
spot. “Look there, father,” said he, “did
you ever see such a sight before?” “It is
a curious affair, indeed, George.” “But, father,
who made my name there?” “It grew
there, my son.” “I know it grew there,
but who made the letters so as to spell my
name?” “Did they not grow so by chance,
my son?” “O no, sir, they never grew so
by chance.” “Why not, my son?” “Nobody,”
said George, “ever saw a single letter
grow up by chance; and how could a whole
name grow up so even and be spelled so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
exactly right by chance? Somebody planted
it so.” “That is true, George. I planted
it so,” said Mr. Washington, and showed
him how he did it. “Now, George, if letters
could not grow so as to spell your name by
chance, how could the world and all the
things and creatures in it be made so exactly
suited to each other and to some useful purpose,
by chance?”</p>

<p>Thus happily and profitably to young
Washington passed the days of his earliest
years. Mr. Washington’s family government
was steady and reasonable; his treatment
of his children was kind and affectionate.
George was an intelligent boy and
a dutiful son. Never were parent and child
more strongly attached. But, in the providence
of God, only a few years more were
to be allowed them for the enjoyment of
each other’s society, on earth.</p>

<p>About the year 1739, when George was
about seven years old, his father removed
from his estate on Pope’s Creek to a farm
which he owned in Stafford county, on the
Rappahannock river, directly opposite to
Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>Lawrence Washington, the elder of
George’s two half-brothers, became of age
in 1739, and soon afterwards received a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Captain’s commission in a regiment raised
in America, and served with the British
forces in the unsuccessful siege of Carthagena,
conducted by Admiral Vernon and
General Wentworth. Having been absent
in the army about two years, Captain Washington
returned to Virginia. A few months
after his return, his father was taken ill.—George
was then on a visit to some of his
acquaintances, living in Chotanct, in King
George county, about twenty miles from his
father’s residence. Mr. Washington was at
first unwilling to interrupt George in the
enjoyment of his visit; but after his sickness
became alarming, George was sent for, and
reached home but just in time to receive the
parting blessing of his beloved father. He
died on the 12th of April, 1743, at the age of
forty-nine years. George was then eleven
years old.</p>

<p class="noi hang">Family anecdote—George lives with his half-brother

school—his manuscript book of forms—his

<p class="p2">About this time, Captain Lawrence Washington
married Ann, the daughter of Mr.
William Fairfax, a relation of Lord Thomas
Fairfax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Augustine Washington left his estate
on the river Potomac, in Fairfax county, to
his eldest son, Lawrence, who called it
Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon.
He left his estate at Pope’s Creek to his
second son, Augustine. Mrs. Augustine
Washington and her family continued to
reside on the farm near Fredericksburg.—Upon
her now devolved the care of the
plantation. Her first born son, George, continued
to live with her some months after
his father’s death. During this period, a
circumstance happened which shows that
George, though a good boy on the whole,
was not wholly exempt from youthful rashness.
His mother owned a beautiful colt,
which, never having been broken, was remarkably
wild. George delighted to look
at this colt as he pranced about the pasture,
snuffing up the wind, wheeling and halting
and displaying his fine proportions. He
often wished himself upon the colt’s back.
One day he engaged some of his school companions
to come early the next morning and
help him to take a ride before breakfast.—They
came, and found the colt at no great
distance from the house. After a great deal
of difficulty they contrived to corner him
and put a bridle upon him. Several boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
held the bridle while George leaped upon
his back. A violent struggle followed.—The
horse seemed determined to shake off
his rider, and his rider seemed equally determined
to keep his seat. At length the
noble animal, in the fury of his plunges, fell
headlong and burst a blood vessel. This
killed him instantly. George received no
injury by the fall; but when he saw the
poor creature lie dead, and considered his
mother’s attachment to the animal, he began
to look very serious. The call to breakfast
was soon heard. Some of George’s companions
had been invited to take breakfast
with him that morning. The boys were all
remarkably silent at the table. Whether
Mrs. Washington had any suspicions that
all was not right, is uncertain. But she inquired
if they had seen any thing of her
fine sorrel colt, in their rambles. Neither
of the boys replied to this question. She
repeated it. There was now no escape.—George’s
character for truth and frankness
had been tried when he was much younger.
It did not then fail; it must not now fail.
“Your sorrel colt is dead, mother,” replied
George. “Dead, George!” exclaimed Mrs.
Washington, with surprise. “Yes, he is
dead.” “How came he dead, George?”—“I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
will tell you, mother. I am the one in
fault.” He then related all the circumstances
just as they happened. “I very
much regret the loss of my colt,” said Mrs.
Washington; “but I rejoice to hear my son
frankly tell the truth, without showing any
disposition to cast his own faults upon
others.”</p>

<p>Soon after this occurrence, George was
sent to Pope’s Creek, the place of his nativity,
to live with his half-brother Augustine.
The chief object of sending him
there was that he might have the benefit of
a respectable school in the neighborhood,
kept by a Mr. Williams. He remained with
his half-brother and attended that school
about three years. An old gentleman, who
was one of Mr. Williams’s scholars at that
time, has often said that such was George’s
reputation for truth, impartiality and good
judgment among his schoolmates, that they
were continually referring their disputes to
him, and so great was their confidence in
him, that his decisions were seldom called
in question. He said nothing was more
common, when the boys were in high dispute
about some question of fact, than for
one of them to call out, “Well, boys, George
Washington was there! George Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
was there! He knows all about it; and if
he don’t say it was so, why then we will
give it up.”</p>

<p>Though George Washington was naturally
of a resolute and martial spirit, he was habitually
gentle and obliging in his conduct.
He never quarrelled with his companions;
and he would always endeavor to settle their
quarrels with each other. If he could not
calm their passions and prevent their fighting
by his arguments, he would inform the
instructor of their barbarous intentions;
though by doing so he often brought upon
himself their censure at the time.</p>

<p>At Mr. Williams’s school, George was
taught Arithmetic, English Grammar, Book
Keeping, Surveying and Geography.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He
wrote his school exercises in arithmetic and
geometry in a remarkably neat, fair hand.
The number and accuracy of his geometrical
figures, shows the strong bent of his inclination
to mathematical studies. When he
was thirteen years old, he began a manuscript
book, which he entitled “<cite>Forms of
Writing</cite>.” In it he copied out with great
care and exactness, forms of different kinds
used in the transaction of business, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a note of hand, a bill of exchange, a bond,
an indenture, a lease, a will. Then follow
two or three select pieces of poetry. Among
them are “Lines on True Happiness.”—Then
follow a collection of a hundred and
ten maxims, written out and numbered.—These
he entitles “<cite>Rules of civility and
proper behavior in company and conversation</cite>.”
He does not mention from what
source he derived these rules. They seem
well calculated to improve the manners and
morals of a young person, and no doubt had
a favorable influence in forming the future
deportment and character of Washington.
The following is a selection from these
rules.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Weems.</p></div>

<p>1. Every action in company ought to be respectful
to those present.</p>

<p>2. In the presence of others sing not to yourself with
a humming noise, nor drum with your fingers or feet.</p>

<p>3. Sit not while others are standing; speak not when
you should hold your peace; walk not on when others
stop.</p>

<p>4. Turn not your back to others, especially in speaking;
jog not the table or desk on which another is reading
or writing; lean not on any one.</p>

<p>5. Be no flatterer.</p>

<p>6. Read no letters, books or papers in company, unless
there is necessity for doing it, and then ask leave.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Come not near the books or writings of any one, so as
to read them, unless desired; nor give your opinion of
them unasked: also look not nigh when another is
writing a letter.</p>

<p>7. Let your countenance be pleasant, but in serious
matters somewhat grave.</p>

<p>8. Show not yourself glad at the misfortunes of
another, though he were your enemy.</p>

<p>9. When you meet a superior at a door or in a narrow
passage, give way for him to pass.</p>

<p>10. They that are in dignity, or in office, have in all
places the precedency.</p>

<p>11. It is good manners to prefer those to whom we
speak before ourselves; especially if they be above us,
with whom we ought not to begin.</p>

<p>12. Let your discourse with men of business be short
and comprehensive.</p>

<p>13. When visiting the sick, do not be too ready to
play the physician.</p>

<p>14. In writing or speaking, give to every person his
due title, according to his degree and the custom of the
place.</p>

<p>15. Undertake not to teach another in the art which
he professes: it savors of arrogancy.</p>

<p>16. When a person does all he can, do not blame
him, though he does not succeed.</p>

<p>17. Being about to advise or reprehend any one, consider
whether it ought to be done in public or in private,
presently or at some other time, in what terms to do it;
and in reproving, show no signs of choler, but do it
with mildness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>18. Mock not, nor jest at any thing serious.</p>

<p>19. Wherein you reprove another, be unblamable
yourself; for example is more prevalent than precept.</p>

<p>20. Use no reproachful language against any one,
neither curse, nor revile.</p>

<p>21. Be not hasty to believe reports to the disadvantage
of others.</p>

<p>22. In your apparel be modest, and endeavor to accommodate
nature rather than to procure admiration;
keep to the fashions of your equals: such as are civil
and orderly with respect to times and places.</p>

<p>23. Play not the peacock, looking every where about
your person to see if you be well decked, and if your
clothes set handsomely.</p>

<p>24. Associate with persons of good character, if you
have a regard for your own; for it is better to be alone,
than in bad company.</p>

<p>25. Let your conversation be without malice or envy;
and in all cases of passion, admit reason to govern.</p>

<p>26. Be not immodest in urging your friend to discover
a secret.</p>

<p>27. Utter not base or frivolous things among grave
or learned men; nor introduce deep subjects or difficult
questions among the ignorant; nor things hard to be
believed.</p>

<p>28. Jest not where none takes pleasure in mirth;
laugh not loud, nor at all, without occasion. Deride
no man’s misfortune.</p>

<p>29. Speak not injurious words, neither in jest nor in
earnest; scoff at none, though they give occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>30. Be not forward, but friendly and courteous; the
first to salute, hear and answer.</p>

<p>31. Detract not from others; neither be excessive in
commending.</p>

<p>32. Give not advice without being asked.</p>

<p>33. Reprehend not the imperfections of others; for
that belongs to parents, masters and superiors.</p>

<p>34. Gaze not at the marks, or personal blemishes of
others; nor ask how they came.</p>

<p>35. Think before you speak; pronounce not imperfectly,
nor bring out your words too hastily, but orderly
and distinctly.</p>

<p>36. When another speaks, be attentive and disturb
not the audience. If a person hesitate in his words, do
not in general help him out, nor prompt him without
being desired; interrupt him not, nor answer him, till
he has done speaking.</p>

<p>37. Treat with men about business only at fit times.
Whisper not in company.</p>

<p>38. Make no injurious comparisons; and if any of
the company be commended for a brave or virtuous
action, commend not another immediately upon it for
a similar action.</p>

<p>39. Be not apt to relate news if you know not the
truth of it. In conversing of what you have heard, do
not always name your author. Discover not a secret.</p>

<p>40. Be not curious to know the affairs of others;
neither approach those who are speaking in private.</p>

<p>41. Undertake not what you cannot perform; but be
careful to keep your promises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>42. Be not tedious in discourse; make not many digressions,
nor repeat the same thing often.</p>

<p>43. Speak not evil of the absent, for it is unjust.</p>

<p>44. Eat not with greediness; lean not on the table.</p>

<p>45. Set not yourself at the upper end of the table;
but if the master of the house will have it so, contend
not, lest you trouble the company.</p>

<p>46. When you speak of God, or his attributes, let it
be seriously and with reverence. Honor and obey
your natural parents.</p>

<p>47. Let your recreations be manful, not sinful.</p>

<p>48. Labor to keep alive in your breast that little
spark of celestial fire called conscience.</p>

<p class="noi hang">Came very near entering the British Navy at the age
of fourteen—attends school at Fredericksburg—becomes
a practical surveyor at the age of sixteen—the

appointed Adjutant General of the Militia, with
the rank of Major, at the age of nineteen—accompanies
his half-brother Lawrence to Barbadoes—Lawrence
dies and leaves George the Mount Vernon
estate.</p>


<p class="p2">While George lived with his half-brother
Augustine at Pope’s Creek, he was taught
the manual exercise by Adjutant Muse, a
Westmoreland volunteer, who had been in
the service with his other half-brother, Lawrence.
He was also instructed in the art of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
fencing, by Mr. Van Braam, who afterwards
accompanied him against the French as his
interpreter.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> J. Sparks.</p></div>

<p>In the summer of 1746, George left Mr.
Williams’s school in Westmoreland county,
and returned home to his mother’s, in Stafford
county. He was then about fourteen
years old. Soon after his return he became
very desirous to enter the British navy.—His
half-brother Lawrence approved his
choice. Mr. William Fairfax, the father-in-law
of Lawrence, was desirous that George’s
inclination for the navy should be gratified.
They both used their influence with his
mother in favor of the project. She at first
seemed to consent, though reluctantly.—Lawrence
procured him a midshipman’s
warrant. But as the time of separation drew
near, her maternal feelings and more mature
reflection caused his mother to waver in her
decision. She suggested many objections
to the plan; and seemed to listen with more
satisfaction to those who opposed, than to
those who approved of it. In September,
during her suspense upon the subject, George
went to see and further consult his brother
Lawrence at Mount Vernon, and other friends
in the county of Fairfax. On this occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
he spent a little time at the house of Mr.
William Fairfax, who is said to have been
an amiable and excellent man. During this
visit, George told Mr. Fairfax that he was
willing to follow the advice of his brother
Lawrence, as his best friend. On his return
home, however, George found his
mother so decidedly opposed to his going to
sea, and her feelings so tenderly affected at
the thought of his leaving her, that he gave
it up entirely; thinking it his duty to sacrifice
his inclinations, in this case, to her happiness.
When we consider that this scheme
was suited to captivate his youthful fancy,
that it was encouraged by some of his most
judicious friends, and that the necessary
preparations were made for carrying it into
effect, it is evident that the sacrifice was
great, and a proof of filial affection and dutiful
regard highly honorable to him. It must
be admitted that the mother’s feelings were
truly parental, and her wishes reasonable,
when it is considered that George was her
eldest son, that his father was dead, and that
she was left with five younger children.—This
decision was probably an event of
Providence, upon which the very existence
of the United States, as an independent nation,
depended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>After this, George lived a part of his time
with his brother Lawrence, at Mount Vernon,
and a part of the time with his mother,
near Fredericksburg, and went to school in
that town. Here he made great improvement
in the art of surveying.</p>

<p>In March, 1748, being then sixteen years
old, he engaged as a surveyor of lands, associated
with Mr. George Fairfax, in the
employ of Lord Thomas Fairfax. They
set out on a surveying tour to the western
parts of Virginia, on the 13th of March, accompanied
by their assistants, and travelled
in a north westerly direction, nearly in
range with the Potomac. The first day
they rode to the residence of Lord Fairfax,
in Frederick county, passing through beautiful
groves of sugar trees, and admiring the
richness of the land upon the river Shenandoah.
The next day they sent on their
baggage to a place now called Winchester,
and worked industriously for several succeeding
days, surveying land in the neighborhood.
They then travelled about forty
miles further into the country, in a continual
rain, swimming their horses over the rivers,
which were then very high. Just after the
rain ceased and the weather had cleared
away, they were agreeably surprised by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
appearance of more than thirty friendly
Indians, returning from war. The surveying
party remained to witness the performance
of their war dance. After clearing a
large space of ground and making a fire in
the middle of it, the Indians seated themselves
around the fire. The speaker then
made a grand speech, in which he told them
in what manner they were to dance. When
the speech was ended, the best dancer
jumped up as if suddenly awaked from sleep,
and ran and jumped about the ring in a most
comical manner. He was soon followed by
the others, in a similar style. Their dance
was accompanied by appropriate music.—One
Indian beat time upon a deer-skin
stretched tightly over a vessel half full of
water, while another rattled a gourd shell
with shot in it, and a piece of a horse’s tail
tied to it, to make it look finely.</p>

<p>One windy night, about a week after,
the straw on which Washington was asleep,
in the tent, took fire; but one of the party
fortunately awoke in time to extinguish it.
A few days after, their tent was blown down
by the violence of the wind. They occasionally
shot a wild turkey or two, which
they cooked upon forked sticks instead of
spits, and ate upon large chips instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
plates. After becoming fatigued by travelling
about all day, they usually camped out
in the forest, and slept with their clothes on
all night. During this tour, young Washington
and his party surveyed between two
and three thousand acres of land, and arrived
safely home on the 12th of April, having
been absent just one month.</p>

<p>For three years, young Washington was
occupied nearly all the time, when the season
would permit, in surveying wild lands
among the Alleghany mountains and on the
southern branches of the river Potomac.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
His surveying expeditions were attended
with so many hardships and privations, that
he was rarely out more than a few weeks at
a time, upon any one of them. In the intervals
of these expeditions, he made it his
home with his brother Lawrence, at Mount
Vernon, though he passed a part of his time
with his mother.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1751, young Washington,
though but nineteen years of age, was appointed
Adjutant General of the northern
division of the Virginia militia, with the
rank of Major.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The health of his brother Lawrence had
been declining for several years. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
made a voyage to England, and afterwards
passed some time at the Bath springs, in
Virginia, without receiving any material
benefit from either. In the autumn of 1751,
he decided to take a voyage to the West
Indies, as the last remedy proposed by his
physicians. By his request, his brother
George, to whom he was much attached,
accompanied him on this voyage. They
sailed for the island of Barbadoes on the
28th of September, and arrived there about
the 3d of November. They procured a
pleasant and airy place to board, near the
sea shore, and were treated with great hospitality
and attention by the principal inhabitants
on the island. George was pleased
with the richness of the soil, the value of
the crops, the variety and excellence of the
fruits, and the elevated and beautiful prospects
in every direction. He was seized
with the small pox on the 17th of November,
and it was nearly a month before he recovered
from it. On the 22d of November,
he embarked on board a vessel called the
Industry, for Virginia, leaving his brother
still at Barbadoes. After a tempestuous
passage of more than five weeks, he arrived
in Virginia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Lawrence, not receiving the relief expected
from the climate of Barbadoes, went
to Bermuda, in March. His health continuing
to fail, he returned home in the
course of the summer, and died at Mount
Vernon, July 26, 1752. George was at
Mount Vernon when his brother died, and
immediately took charge of his affairs. On
opening his will, it was found that he had
given to George the Mount Vernon estate,
and some valuable lands in Berkley county,
Virginia.</p>

<p class="noi hang">Washington’s mission from the Governor of Virginia
to the French commandant, at the age of twenty-one—narrowly
escapes being killed by an Indian—came
near being drowned in the Allegany river—visits
Queen Aliquippa.</p>


<p class="p2">Information had been received, from time
to time, that the French were making encroachments
on what was deemed British
territory, beyond the Allegany mountains,
and that a French army was approaching
from Canada to build forts on the Ohio river
and to take possession of the whole country.
As this territory was supposed to be within
the limits of Virginia, the Governor of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
colony<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> resolved to send a messenger with
a letter to the French commandant on the
Ohio, to demand of him an answer, to ascertain
important facts, and to make useful
observations. Major George Washington
was selected for this arduous undertaking.
His knowledge of the Indians, his habits of
living and travelling in the woods acquired
on his surveying expeditions, and certain
traits in his character, well fitted him for
this delicate and important mission, though
he was not yet twenty-two years of age.—He
was commissioned by the Governor on
the 30th of October, 1753, and the same
day set out upon his dangerous journey.—On
the 14th of November he arrived at the
mouth of Wills Creek, now Cumberland, on
the river Potomac, having engaged a French
interpreter and procured the necessary supply
of provisions, horses, &amp;c., on the way.
Here he engaged Mr. Gist, an experienced
Indian trader, to accompany him; also, an
Indian interpreter, and four other men as
attendants; and with these men, left the
place the next day. The excessive rains
and the vast quantities of snow which had
fallen, prevented their reaching the river
Monongahela till the 22d of November.—Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
they learned that expresses had been
sent down the river a few days before, with
information of the French General’s death,
and the return of the greater part of the
French troops into winter quarters.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Dinwiddie.</p></div>

<p>As the late rains had rendered the rivers
impassable without swimming their horses,
Washington sent two of his men, with the
baggage, in a canoe, about ten miles down
the river Monongahela, to meet the rest of
the party at the fork of the Ohio, now Pittsburg.
As young Washington arrived at the
fork before the canoe, he spent some time
in viewing the two rivers, Monongahela and
Allegany, at and near their junction which
forms the Ohio, and examining the land in
the fork, which, having the command of
both rivers, he thought well situated for a
fort.</p>

<p>On the Allegany river, about two miles
above the fork, lived Shingiss, King of the
Delawares, an Indian chief friendly to the
English. Washington, with his attendants,
called upon this chief, and invited him to
attend a council at a place called Logstown,
about twenty miles west of his residence.
He accepted the invitation, and accompanied
Washington and his men to Logstown.—They
arrived about sunset. Washington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
found that the friendly chief, called the
Half-King, whom he particularly wished to
see, was out at his hunting cabin on little
Beaver Creek, about fifteen miles distant.
Washington, by his Indian interpreter, informed
the Half-King’s principal man at
Logstown that he was a messenger to the
French commandant, and was ordered to
call upon the Sachems of the Six Nations
and inform them of the fact. He then gave
him a string of wampum and a twist of tobacco,
and desired him to send for the Half-King.
The man promised to dispatch a
runner for him the next morning. Washington
invited him and other chief men to
his tent in the evening. They came and
staid about an hour. About three o’clock
in the afternoon of the next day, the Half-King
arrived. He told Washington that
the French had lately built two forts about
fifteen miles apart, one on Lake Erie, and
the other on French Creek, which falls into
the Allegany from the north, and near a
small lake. He gave Washington a plan of
both these forts, of his own drawing. He
said the present French commandant was
at the fort on French Creek, and that he
could not reach in less than five or six nights
sleep, in good travelling. The next day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Washington met several chiefs in council,
and delivered a friendly speech to them, in
which he briefly stated the object of his
visit, and requested an escort of warriors to
the French commandant. This was replied
to in the same spirit by the Half-King.—Runners
were dispatched very early the
next morning, for the purpose of assembling
a more full council, but not many came.—It
was, however, agreed to furnish Washington
and his men a convoy, to consist of
three chiefs, namely, Half-King, Jeskakake
and White Thunder, and one of their best
hunters.</p>

<p>They all set out from Logstown on the
30th of November, and travelled in continual
bad weather till the 4th of December,
when they reached Venango, a settlement
at the place where French Creek falls into
the Allegany river. This place is now the
town of Franklin, the capital of Venango
county. They saw the French colors flying
at a house in Venango. Washington went
immediately to the house to inquire where
the commandant resided. Here he found a
Captain and three other French officers.—The
Captain informed him that he, himself,
had the immediate command on the river,
but that there was a general officer at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
first fort above, to which he advised him to
proceed with his dispatches. He invited
Washington and his party to sup with him
and his officers, and treated them with great
complaisance. The badness of the weather
and the winning treatment which the Indians
received from the French, combined to detain
Washington and his party at Venango
three days. Monsieur La Force, commissary
of the French stores, with three soldiers, accompanied
them up the Creek. The travelling
was so bad they did not reach the fort
on French Creek till the 12th of December.</p>

<p>The French commandant was the Chevalier
de Saint Pierre, a knight of the military
order of St. Louis. Washington waited on
him soon after his arrival, and was received
and conducted to him by the second officer
in command. Washington acquainted the
Chevalier with his business, and presented
his commission and letter. While the commandant
was in consultation with his officers
upon the communication from the Governor
of Virginia, in a private apartment, Washington
embraced the opportunity of examining
the strength and taking the dimensions
of the fort, and of making other observations.
He was satisfied that the garrison contained
upwards of a hundred soldiers. One of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
people, by his direction, took an account of
upwards of two hundred canoes, hauled up
and prepared to convey the French forces
down the river at the proper season.</p>

<p>On the 14th, the snow was so deep that
Washington sent off his horses very lightly
loaded, in the care of four of his men, to
Venango, having determined to go down
himself, with the remainder of his party, in
a canoe. Young Washington had to contend
with a variety of mild and artful means
used to detain his convoy of Indians, and
to draw them away from the English interests.
He was at length obliged to assume
a tone of remonstrance before he could
induce the French and Indians to part.—The
French commandant, at last, ordered a
plentiful store of provisions to be put on
board Washington’s boat, and appeared very
friendly and complaisant. They had a tedious
passage down the Creek. They found
it extremely crooked. Several times they
came near being staved against the rocks.
At times they were all hands obliged to get
out, and remain in the water half an hour
or more, getting over the shoals. At one
place, the ice had lodged and blocked up the
passage by water, so that they were obliged
to carry their boat a quarter of a mile across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a neck of land. They did not reach Venango
till the 22d. Here they found their
horses.</p>

<p>The next day, when Washington was
prepared to leave Venango, he inquired of
the Half-King whether he intended to go
down with him by land or to go by water.
He replied that White Thunder had hurt
himself badly, and was sick and unable to
walk, and that he must carry him down in
a canoe. As Washington found that the
Half-King intended to stay behind a few
days, he cautioned him against the flatteries
of the French. He desired Washington not
to be concerned, for he knew the French
too well to be influenced by them against
the English. He offered to order the young
hunter to attend Washington and his party,
and procure provisions for them on their
journey. He said he should soon be at the
forks, and there deliver a speech, to be
carried to his Honor the Governor of Virginia.
Washington then took leave of the
Half-King, and with his party left Venango.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far, before the
horses seemed to be so feeble, and the baggage
so heavy for them, that Washington
and his party, except the drivers, dismounted
and went on foot with packs on their backs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to help forward the baggage. Washington,
in an Indian walking dress, continued with
his men three days under this arrangement,
till he found there was no probability of
his reaching home in this manner, in any
reasonable season. He then committed the
party to the charge of his French interpreter
with proper directions, tied himself up in a
watch coat, put his necessary papers into his
pack with his provisions, took his gun in his
hand, and set forward with Mr. Gist, fitted
in the same manner, the nearest way home
through the woods. The day following,
just after they had passed a place called
<i>Murdering Town</i>, they fell in with a party
of Indians in the French interest, who had
been lying in wait for them. One of the
Indians fired at Washington, not fifteen
steps from him, but providentially missed
him. They instantly took the fellow into
custody, and kept him with them till about
nine o’clock in the evening, when they let
him go, and walked all night without making
any stop, that they might get so far the
start of the Indians as to be out of the reach
of their pursuit the next day, having no
doubt their tracks would be followed as soon
as it was light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day they continued travelling
till it was quite dark, when they reached
the Allegany river about two miles above
the forks of the Ohio. There was no way
for them to get over the river but upon a raft.
The next morning they set about making
one, with the assistance of but one poor
hatchet, and finished it just after sunset.—The
next day they launched it, went on
board and pushed off; but before they were
half across the river, they were so wedged
in between flakes of ice running forcibly
down stream, that they expected every moment
their raft would sink and themselves
perish. Young Washington put out his
setting pole to stop the raft, that the ice
might pass by it, when the rapidity of the
stream threw the ice with so much violence
against his pole that it jerked him into the
river. He instantly seized hold of one of
the raft logs and saved himself from the
dashing flakes of ice, by springing to his
former station on the raft. In spite of all
their efforts they could not get to either
shore; but were obliged to quit their raft
and pass from one mass of ice to another,
till they reached a small island in the river.
Here they spent the night. The cold was
so extremely severe that Mr. Gist had all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
his fingers and part of his toes frozen. They
left the island the next morning, on the ice,
without difficulty, and went to the house of
a trader, on the Monongahela, a few miles
distant. About three miles from this house,
there was an Indian settlement on the spot
where the Monongahela and Youghiogany
rivers unite, where the Indian Queen Alliquippa
held her rude court. She had expressed
great concern that Washington and
his party had passed her by without attention,
on his way to the French fort; and,
as he was now waiting for horses, (which,
by the by, he failed to obtain,) he took this
opportunity to make a visit to her majesty.
Though it is evident that Queen Alliquippa,
like persons of similar rank and birth in
Europe, was very tenacious of the respect
due to royalty, we are not informed by
Washington, with what particular marks of
attention she received him. We may, however,
form some idea of the style which he
found prevalent at court, from the nature of
the present which he made her. He presented
her with a box coat.</p>

<p>About thirty miles from this Indian settlement,
Washington bought a fresh horse,
rode on to Wills Creek, and reached Williamsburg
on the 16th of January, 1754.—He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
immediately waited upon the Governor,
delivered his letter from the French commandant,
together with a journal of his proceedings
and observations during the tour.
This journal was published in England, and
has been several times reprinted in this
country. Major Washington thus completed
his perilous expedition, and accomplished
the objects of it in such a faithful and able
manner as gave entire satisfaction.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_FIFTH" id="CHAPTER_FIFTH">CHAPTER FIFTH.</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="noi hang">Major Washington, at the age of twenty-two, is appointed
to command the regular Virginia forces, consisting
of two companies—being increased to six
companies, he is raised to the rank of Lieutenant
Colonel, and made second in command—his modesty—the
fort, just begun at the fork of the Ohio, surrenders
to the French—Washington attacks and defeats
a party of French.</p>


<p class="p2">By the then existing law of Virginia, the
militia could not be required to march more
than five miles beyond the boundary line
of the colony. For this reason, if for no
other, the militia alone could not be depended
upon for the defence of the colony.
After Washington’s return, the Governor
and council of Virginia determined to raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
two companies, of one hundred men each,
by enlistment, and send them to erect and
defend a fort at the fork of the Ohio, now
Pittsburg, that being the spot pointed out
by Washington as well situated for a fort.
Major Washington, then but twenty-two
years old, was appointed to command these
two companies. He was to enlist one of
the companies himself, and he did enlist
about fifty men. Captain Trent, having
partly filled the other company in the back
settlement, was ordered immediately to the
place of destination. It was soon determined,
however, to increase this force to three
hundred men, and to divide them into six
companies. In a letter to a friend of his,
then a member of the Governor’s council,
Major Washington says: “The command of
this whole force I neither expect nor desire;
for I must be impartial enough to confess,
it is a charge too great for my youth and
inexperience. Knowing this, I have too
sincere a love for my country to undertake
that which may tend to the prejudice of it.”</p>

<p>Young Washington was, however, raised
to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and made
second in command. He left Alexandria
with his troops, for the frontier, on the 2d
of April, 1754, and being joined by a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
detachment in his route, arrived at Wills
Creek on the 20th, with one hundred and
fifty men. He was here met by Captain
Trent’s ensign, Mr. Ward, directly from the
fort just begun at the fork of the Ohio, with
the unpleasant information that he had been
obliged to surrender to a French force of
one thousand men, with eighteen pieces of
cannon, on the 17th of April. He said that
the Captain and the Lieutenant (Frazier)
were both absent at the time, and that the
whole number of men under his command
was but forty-one. He stated that the
French commander approached near the fort,
halted his troops, and sent in an officer with
a summons to surrender, allowing him but
one hour to consider of it, and directing him
to come to the French camp at the expiration
of the hour, with his determination in
writing. He asked the Half-King, who was
in the fort at the time, what it was best to
do. The chief advised him to inform the
French that he was not an officer of rank,
nor invested with power to answer their
summons, and request them to wait till his
commander should arrive. He accordingly
went with this reply to the French camp,
accompanied by the Half-King; but the
French commander refused to wait, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
them that he must have an immediate and
decisive answer, or he should take possession
of the fort by force. He then agreed to
surrender, with liberty to depart with his
men the next day. The French commander
invited the ensign to supper in the evening,
and treated him with much civility. The
seizure of this post was considered by the
British, at the time, the first open act of
hostility in the memorable French war
which followed it. The French fortified
the post strongly, and called it Fort Du
Quesne.</p>

<p>Colonel Washington considered that the
British territory was now actually invaded,
and that it was his duty, in compliance with
his orders, to march forward prepared to
meet the invading foe. A council of war
was held, which confirmed this opinion, and
resolved to proceed to the junction of Red
Stone Creek with the river Monongahela,
thirty-seven miles south of Fort Du Quesne,
there build a fort and wait for reinforcements.
Colonel Fry, the chief in command, being
detained by bad health, Lieutenant Colonel
Washington with his one hundred and fifty
men, moved on through the wilderness and
over the mountains with all possible dispatch.
He first sent forward sixty men to prepare a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
passage by mending the road, and in some
places making a new one; and on the 1st of
May, followed them with the main body.
In the course of the march, the friendly
Indians brought to Washington frequent reports
of French scouts being seen in the
woods. When he had advanced about fifty
miles beyond Wills Creek, he met a messenger
from the Half-King, informing him that
a French force (how large he could not tell)
was on its march to attack the English, and
warning him to be on his guard. This induced
Washington to fall back a few miles
to a favorable place for meeting the enemy,
called the Great Meadows. Here he immediately
employed his men in clearing away
the bushes and throwing up an intrenchment,
and sent a small party to look out for
the enemy and observe their strength and
motions. But the party returned without
seeing any thing of them. The troops were,
however, alarmed in the night, and were
under arms during the latter part of it.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 27th, an English
trader who lived in the neighborhood, came
to the camp from his residence, where a detachment
of fifty Frenchmen, he said, had
been seen the day before at noon. He added
that he saw their tracks himself about five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
miles distant. Washington immediately
sent out seventy-five men in pursuit of this
party; but they returned without discovering
it. Washington sent a messenger to the
Half-King, who was encamped with some
of his people about six miles distant. This
messenger returned about nine o’clock in the
evening, with information from the Half-King
that he had seen the tracks of two
Frenchmen across the road, which had been
traced to an obscure part of the woods, and
that he thought the main body of them
must be concealed at no great distance.—Washington,
suspecting a design to surprise
him, set out that night with forty men for
the Indian’s camp. The night was dark
and rainy, and they often lost the path and
were unable to find it again for fifteen or
twenty minutes. They, however, arrived
at the Indian’s camp before sunrise. The
Half-King agreed “to go hand in hand with
their brothers the English,” (as they called
them,) “and strike the French.” Accordingly
they set out together, and proceeded
through the woods in single file, after the
manner of the Indians, till they came to the
place where the tracks were. The Half-King
then sent two Indians to follow these
tracks again, till they should find the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
spot where the enemy lay. The two Indians
soon discovered them about half a mile from
the road, in a very retired place, surrounded
by rocks. The men were immediately
formed for the attack. They then advanced,
with Washington at their head, till they
came very near the French. The moment
the French discovered them, they seized
their arms. Washington gave the order to
fire, and a brisk engagement ensued, which
continued about fifteen minutes. The
French were defeated with the loss of their
whole party, except one who escaped, ten
men being killed, including Jumonville,
their commander, one wounded and twenty-one
taken prisoners. Colonel Washington’s
loss was one man killed, and a Lieutenant
and two privates wounded. As the French
directed their fire chiefly at Washington’s
men, the Indians received no injury. This
skirmish took place on the 28th of May,
1754, at about seven o’clock in the morning.
It was the first battle in which Washington
had ever been engaged.</p>

<p class="noi hang">Battle of the Great Meadows—vote of thanks to Colonel
Washington and his officers—disapproving of the
arrangement of the Virginia troops, he retires from
the service.</p>


<p class="p2">Colonel Fry died at Wills Creek on the
31st of May. By his death, the command
of the expedition devolved on Washington.
Reinforcements were soon forwarded, so
that the whole number composing the Virginia
regiment under his immediate command,
was three hundred men. There was
also with him an independent company from
South Carolina, consisting of about one
hundred men. With this force Colonel
Washington advanced slowly and cautiously
beyond the Great Meadows, employing his
soldiers in repairing the road, and sending
out scouting parties to watch the motions of
the enemy. He also sent a party forward to
clear a passage towards the mouth of Red
Stone Creek, the place of the intended fort.
He also held councils with several Indian
chiefs who came to him for that purpose,
heard and delivered speeches, exchanged
belts of wampum, and went through the
usual ceremonies on such occasions. But
all this was to little purpose; for some of
the Indians were spies from the French, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the only motive of others was to obtain
presents of goods and provisions. In this
mode of gaining friends, the French were
more successful than the English, as they
were better supplied with such articles as
the Indians wanted.</p>

<p>While these operations were going on, reports
were continually brought in by French
deserters and Indians that reinforcements
had arrived at Fort Du Quesne, and that a
large force would soon come out to attack
the English. These accounts came from
many different sources, some of which were
so authentic that a council of war was held,
in which it was unanimously resolved that
the army should return to the Great Meadows,
there fortify themselves in the best manner
they could, and wait for a supply of provisions
and reinforcements. The retreat
immediately commenced. They had so
few horses that the Colonel loaded his own
horse with ammunition and other public
stores, marched on foot himself, and paid the
soldiers from his own purse for carrying his
private baggage. Other officers followed
his example. The troops were short of provisions,
and having to carry their baggage on
their backs and draw nine swivels over a very
broken road, they did not reach the Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Meadows till the 1st of July. The Colonel
immediately sent off an express to hasten
on the expected supplies and reinforcements,
but they did not arrive. He set his men to
felling trees, preparing and drawing together
logs, and raising and strengthening the
breastworks. This entrenchment was called
<i>Fort Necessity</i>, on account of the circumstances
attending the erection and original
use of it.</p>

<p>On the third of July, early in the morning,
an alarm was given by a sentinel who
had been wounded by the enemy. At nine
o’clock, intelligence was received that the
whole body of the French, amounting to
nine hundred men, was only four miles distant.
They were commanded by M. De
Villiers, brother of Jumonville. At eleven
o’clock they approached the fort, and began
to fire, at the distance of six hundred yards,
but without effect. Colonel Washington
had drawn up his men on the open and level
ground outside of the trenches, awaiting the
attack, which he supposed would be made
immediately, having ordered his men to reserve
their fire till the enemy were so near
that it would certainly do execution. But
the French kept up a distant firing from the
woods. Washington considered this as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
stratagem to draw his men into the woods
and there take them at a disadvantage. He
therefore maintained his position till he
found that the French did not incline to
leave the woods and attack the fort by assault,
as he had thought they would, considering
their superiority of numbers. He
then drew his men back within the trenches,
and gave them orders to fire as they found
favorable opportunities of doing so with effect.
The French and Indians remained on
the side of a piece of rising ground near the
fort, and sheltered by the trees, kept up a
brisk fire of musketry upon it, but never appeared
upon the open plain below.</p>

<p>In this way, the battle continued till eight
o’clock in the evening, when the French
called out and proposed a parley. Suspecting
this to be a mere feint in order to procure
the admission of a French officer into
the fort to spy out his condition, the Colonel
at first declined the proposal; but when the
call was repeated, with the request that an
officer might be sent to them, and with the
pledge of their parol of honor for his safety,
he sent out Captain Van Braam, the only
person under his command who could speak
French, excepting the Chevalier De Payrouny,
an ensign in the Virginia regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
who was dangerously wounded and disabled.
Van Braam returned, and brought with him
M. De Villiers and the proposed articles of
capitulation. These he read and interpreted.
After making some alterations in the articles,
by mutual agreement, both parties signed
them about midnight.</p>

<p>By the terms of the capitulation, the
whole garrison was to march out of the fort
the next morning, with the honors of war,
their drums beating and their colors flying;
and to return home with every thing in
their possession, excepting their artillery,
unmolested by the French or the savages.
As the French had killed all the horses and
cattle, Colonel Washington had no means
of carrying away his heavy baggage and
stores; and the French agreed that a guard
might be left to protect them, till horses
could be sent to take them away. It was
agreed that the prisoners taken at the skirmish
with Jumonville should be returned;
and to secure the performance of this article,
Captain Van Braam and Captain Stobo were
delivered up to the French to be retained by
them as hostages. Early the next morning,
Colonel Washington began his march
from the fort in good order; but he had not
proceeded far, when a body of one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Indians came upon him and could hardly
be restrained from attacking his men. They
pilfered the baggage and did other mischief.
He proceeded on, however, with as much
speed as possible, till he arrived at Wells
Creek settlement, now Cumberland, in the
State of Maryland. Thence he proceeded
to Williamsburg, and communicated to the
Governor in person the events of the campaign.
Much dissatisfaction was expressed
with some of the articles of capitulation,
when they were made public. The legislature
of Virginia, however, after maturely
considering them, passed a vote of thanks
to Colonel Washington and his officers for
their brave defence of the country. Indeed,
all the proceedings of the campaign, though
not finally successful, were generally approved
and applauded.</p>

<p>The exact number engaged in the action
at the Great Meadows, cannot be ascertained.
According to a return made by Colonel
Washington himself, the Virginia regiment,
including officers, consisted of three hundred
and five men, of which twelve were killed
and forty-three wounded. The company of
South Carolinians was said to contain about
one hundred; but the number of them
killed and wounded is not known. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
French force was probably not far from
nine hundred. M. De Villiers says he left
Fort Du Quesne with five hundred Frenchmen
and eleven Indians. The number of
French is probably correct; but the Indians
were much more numerous when they arrived
at the scene of action.</p>

<p>Although there was at this time a disagreement
between the Governor and the
Legislature of Virginia, which prevented the
appropriation of money for the service, the
Governor and his counsel resolved to renew
the contest with the French without delay.
When Washington was informed of this, he
expostulated so warmly against attempting
such an enterprise, without money, men, or
provisions, that it was abandoned.</p>

<p>The Assembly met in October, 1754, and
granted £20,000. The Governor received
from England £10,000 in specie, with the
promise of as much more, and two thousand
fire arms. The Governor and his counsel
then resolved that the army should be divided
into ten independent companies, of one
hundred men each, and should contain no
officer above the rank of Captain. Washington,
disapproving of this singular arrangement
as unfavorable to the interest of the
service, retired from the army to his farm.</p>

<p class="noi hang">Is invited by General Braddock to join his expedition
as a volunteer—accepts the invitation—Battle of
Monongahela—Washington conducts the retreat
with ability, and retains the confidence of the public.</p>


<p class="p2">On the 20th of February, 1755, General
Braddock arrived in Virginia, from England,
as Commander in Chief of all the military
forces in North-America. He brought with
him two Regiments of the British Army,
consisting of five hundred men each. One
of them was commanded by Sir Peter Halket,
and the other by Colonel Dunbar.
These were accompanied by a proper train
of artillery and sufficient military supplies
and provisions. The General made his first
head quarters at Alexandria. He addressed,
through his Aid-de-Camp, a polite letter to
Colonel Washington, inviting him, as he had
declined any military command under the
Virginia regulations, to join his family as a
volunteer, and accompany him upon his intended
expedition against Fort Du Quesne,
as one of his aids, and desiring him to consult
his own pleasure and convenience, as
to the particular time of joining the army.
Colonel Washington accepted this invitation.
General Braddock marched from Alexandria
for Fort Cumberland at the mouth of Wills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Creek on the 20th of April. Colonel Washington
left Mount Vernon on the 23d, and
overtook the army in a few days at Fredericktown,
in Virginia. The army arrived at
Fort Cumberland about the middle of May.
It then consisted of more than two thousand
men. About one thousand of them were
colonial troops. The army was detained at
this post three weeks; nor could it then
have moved on, but for the personal exertions
of Benjamin Franklin, and his influence
among the Pennsylvanian farmers, in
procuring horses and wagons, to transport
the artillery, provisions, and baggage. During
the detention of the army at Fort Cumberland,
Colonel Washington was dispatched
to Williamsburg, in the eastern part of Virginia,
to obtain £4000 in money, for the use
of the army, and to bring it on to the camp.
He promptly and successfully executed this
commission, taking with him at Winchester,
on his return, a sufficient guard of militia
through the most unfrequented and dangerous
part of the route.</p>

<p>About the first of June, a detachment was
sent forward to open the roads as far as a
place called Little Meadows, about twenty
miles beyond Fort Cumberland, and
there to erect a small Fort. The main body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
soon followed this detachment, and when
they came up with it, the whole army was
divided into two divisions. The advanced
division under General Braddock, consisted
of about twelve hundred men. The other
division, consisting of about eight hundred
men under Colonel Dunbar, was left in the
rear to proceed with the baggage by slow
marches. Washington says in a letter to
his brother John Augustine, (the father of
Judge Lund Washington,) written on the
march, that the advance of the first division
of the army, though retarded by many real
obstacles and difficulties, was yet unnecessarily
slow, in consequence of halting to
level too many mole hills, and to build
bridges over too many brooks. Colonel Washington
accompanied the advanced division
until a fever with which he was taken on the
march became so violent, that he was
obliged to fall in the rear, into Colonel Dunbar’s
division.</p>

<p>General Braddock arrived with his division,
all in fine health and spirits, at the
junction of the Monongahela and Youghiogany
rivers on the 8th of July. On the
same day Colonel Washington, though but
partially recovered from his fever, reached
that place in a covered wagon, and joined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the advanced division. Owing to a bend in
the Monongahela, it was necessary for the
army in approaching Fort Du Quesne, now
about fifteen miles distant, to ford the river
twice. The remarkable dryness of the season
rendered this practicable. Early in the
morning of the 9th of July, all things were
in readiness, and the whole train, a little below
the mouth of the Youghiogany, passed
through the river Monongahela, and proceeded
in perfect order along the southern
margin of it. Colonel Washington, though
feeble, attended the General on horseback.
He was often heard to say, in the course of
his after life, that one of the most beautiful
spectacles he had ever seen, was the display
of the British troops on this eventful morning.
Every man was neatly dressed in full
uniform. The soldiers were arranged in
columns and marched in exact order. The
sun gleamed upon their burnished arms.
The river flowed tranquilly on their right,
and the deep forest often overshadowed them
on their left. When they had marched about
five miles, they arrived to the second crossing
place, ten miles from Fort Du Quesne. They
halted a little, and then began to ford the
river and gain its northern bank. As soon
as they had crossed, they came to a level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
plain, nearly half a mile in extent. At the
end of the plain was a piece of gently rising
ground, covered with trees, bushes and long
grass. The road to Fort Du Quesne led
across this plain. It then led up the rising
ground, between two ravines from eight to
ten feet deep, and of sufficient extent to contain
five hundred men each. Owing to the
trees, bushes and high grass, these ravines
could not be seen from the road, nor without
coming within a few feet of them. By
the order of march, a body of three hundred
men under Lieutenant Colonel Gage, afterwards
commander of the British forces in
Boston at the beginning of the revolution,
formed the advanced party. This was followed
by about two hundred. Next came
General Braddock with the main body, the
artillery and baggage. He sent out no
scouts nor guards in advance and on the
wings of the army to make discoveries and
prevent a surprise. Washington advised
him to proceed more cautiously, but he was
self-confident and disregarded the advice.</p>

<p>At 1 o’clock P. M. the whole army had
crossed the river; and almost at the same
moment a sharp firing was heard upon the
advanced parties, who were now ascending
the rising ground. A heavy discharge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
musketry poured in upon their front, gave
them the first notice that an enemy was
near. This was suddenly followed by
another discharge upon their right flank.—These
were followed by others in continual
and rapid succession. They were filled
with the greater consternation because no
enemy was in sight, and the fire seemed to
come from an invisible foe. They fired,
however, in their turn, but at random and
without effect. The General speedily advanced
to the relief of the detachments;
but before he could reach them, they gave
way and fell back upon the artillery and
other columns, causing extreme confusion,
and striking the whole mass with such a
panic that no order could afterwards be restored.
The yell of the savages with which
the woods resounded, struck terror into the
hearts of the British soldiers, and added to
the consternation. The General and his
officers behaved with the utmost courage.
They made every effort to rally the men
and bring them to order, but all in vain.—In
this state they continued nearly three
hours, huddling together in confused bodies,
firing irregularly, shooting down their own
officers and comrades, and doing little or no
harm to the enemy. The Virginians were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the only troops who seemed to retain their
senses. They behaved with bravery and
resolution. They adopted the Indian mode,
and fought each man for himself behind a
tree. This was forbidden by the General,
who endeavored to form the men into
platoons and columns, as if he were manœvering
them upon the plains of Flanders.—During
all this time, the French and Indians
concealed in the ravines and behind trees,
kept up a continual and deadly discharge of
musketry, singling out their objects, taking
deliberate aim, and producing a carnage almost
unparalleled in the annals of modern
warfare. More than half of that whole
army which had crossed the river in such
proud array only three hours before, were
either killed or wounded. General Braddock,
after having five horses shot under
him, had received a mortal wound, and
many of his best officers had fallen by his
side. Sir Peter Halket was killed upon the
spot. Colonel Washington had two horses
shot under him, and his clothes were shot
through in several places. The bodies left
on the field were stripped and scalped by
the Indians. All the artillery, ammunition,
provisions, baggage, everything in the train
of the army fell into the enemy’s hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and were given up to be pillaged by the
savages.</p>

<p>When the battle was over, and the remnant
of the army had gained in their flight
the opposite bank of the river, Colonel
Washington was dispatched by the General
to meet Colonel Dunbar, and order forward
wagons for the wounded with all possible
speed; but they could not be procured till
after the wounded had suffered much from
pain, fatigue and hunger. The General
was at first brought off the field in a cart.—He
was then set on horseback, but being
unable to ride, was carried by the soldiers.
They reached Dunbar’s camp, near the
Great Meadows, to which the panic had
already extended. A day was passed there
in great confusion. General Braddock died
on the 13th, and was buried in the road, for
the purpose of concealing his body from the
Indians. The spot is still pointed out within
a few yards of the present national road,
about a mile west of the site of Fort Necessity,
at the Great Meadows, in Pennsylvania.
On the 17th, the sick and wounded
arrived at Fort Cumberland on Wills Creek,
and were soon after joined by Colonel Dunbar
with the remnant of the army. The
French sent out a party as far as Dunbar’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
camp and destroyed every thing that had
been left behind.</p>

<p>As to the numbers engaged in the battle
of Monongahela, on the side of the French,
Washington conjectured, as appears by his
letters, that they amounted to no more than
three hundred. Doctor Franklin, in his account
of the battle, considers them as not
exceeding four hundred at most.</p>

<p>It appears by the French narratives of
this battle, that while the commandant of
Fort Du Quesne, considering his force too
small to encounter his approaching enemy,
was hesitating what measures to adopt, M.
De Beaujeu, a Captain in the French service,
obtained from his commandant a detachment
of French troops, with leave to advance
with them and meet the enemy on
their march. After much persuasion, Beaujeu
induced a considerable party of Indians
to join him. He began his march at an
early hour on the morning of the 9th of
July, intending to make a stand at the
second fording place, there to annoy the
English while passing the river, and then
to retreat and make another stand at the
rising ground where the whole contest actually
took place. Captain Beaujeu and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
party did not, however, arrive quite in time
to make a stand at the ford, and thus failed
to carry the first part of their plan into execution.
They however immediately placed
themselves in ambush, partly in front and
partly concealed in the ravines flanking the
road up the rising ground, and there waited
till Braddock’s advanced columns came up.
The French gave the first fire in front.—This
was repelled by so heavy a discharge
from the British, that the Indians thought
it came from artillery, and showed symptoms
of wavering and retreat. At this moment
M. De Beaujeu was killed. M. Dumas
immediately took the command, rallied
the Indians with great presence of mind, ordered
his officers to lead them to the wings,
while, with the French troops, he maintained
the position in front. This order
was promptly obeyed; the attack became
general, and the English columns got into
confusion.</p>

<p>As to the French accounts of their numbers,
the highest states them at two hundred
and fifty French and Canadians and
six hundred and forty Indians, and the
lowest at two hundred and thirty French
and Canadians and six hundred Indians. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
medium between the two will make the
whole number under De Beaujeu eight hundred
and sixty. The French admit, including
Indians, thirty-three killed and
thirty-four wounded.</p>

<p>When these French statements, the nature
of the ground, and the mismanagement
of General Braddock are duly considered,
the result of the action will not appear very
surprising. That the English should say
“they were fighting with an invisible foe,”
and that “they could only tell where the
enemy were by the smoke of their muskets,”
is no mystery, for it was literally true.
Had Braddock known the position of his
enemy, and raked the ravines with his artillery,
or charged through them with the
bayonet, they would have been cleared immediately.</p>

<p>Colonel Washington lost no ground in the
confidence of the public by Braddock’s defeat.
It was the general opinion that if
<em>he</em> had been commander, the defeat would
not have happened. By his firm conduct
during the action, and his skilful management
of the retreat, he gained additional
reputation.</p>

<p class="noi hang">Anecdote—Washington is appointed to command the
Virginia forces—his visit to Boston—commands the
advance division at the taking of Fort Du Quesne—resigns
his military commission—marries—devotes
himself chiefly to agricultural pursuits till called to
take command of the American armies in the war of
Independence.</p>


<p class="p2">About fifteen years after Braddock’s defeat,
as Washington was exploring wild
lands near the Ohio river with a party of
woodmen, a company of Indians came to
them with an interpreter, headed by an aged
and venerable chief. This chief told the
party that, at the battle of Monongahela, he
had singled out Colonel Washington as a
conspicuous object, fired his rifle at him
many times, and directed his young warriors
to do the same, but to his utter astonishment,
none of their balls took effect. He
was then persuaded that the young man
was under the special guardianship of the
Great Spirit, and stopped firing at him any
longer. He said he had come a great way
to pay his respects to a man who was the
peculiar favorite of Heaven, and could never
die in battle.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>About a fortnight after Washington returned
home from Braddock’s defeat, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
was appointed to the chief command of the
Virginia forces, now increased to sixteen
companies, with authority to appoint his
own officers, together with an aid-de-camp
and Secretary. In this command he continued
three years, defending with energy
and resolution three hundred and sixty
miles of frontier against the continual incursions
of a warlike and a savage foe,
though furnished with very inadequate
means for the arduous undertaking. His
discipline was reasonable and steady, but
rigid. Quarreling and fighting, drunkenness,
card playing and profane swearing
were promptly punished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In March, 1756, Colonel Washington
went with his aid to Boston on military
business with General Shirley. He was
treated with much politeness and attention
at Boston. He attended with interest the
proceedings of the Legislature of Massachusetts,
and visited Castle William and other
places worthy of a stranger’s notice. On
his return home, he passed through Providence,
Newport, New London, New York,
and Philadelphia, and spent several days in
each of the two last mentioned cities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The design of the British to carry the
war into Canada, being known to the
French Governor of Canada, he recalled the
greater part of the French troops from the
Ohio river. Only about five hundred men
were left for the defence of the French possessions.</p>

<p>In 1758, another expedition marched
against Fort Du Quesne, under the command
of General Forbes. Colonel Washington
commanded the advanced division of
this army, which was sent forward to clear
and prepare the way for the main body.—The
night before the expedition reached
Fort Du Quesne, the French, amounting to
about five hundred men, set the Fort on
fire, embarked on board their boats by the light
of it, and sailed down the Ohio; so
that the army had nothing to do but to take
possession of the spot where the Fort stood.
This they did on the 25th of November,
1758. General Forbes called the place
Pittsburg, in honor of Mr. Pitt.</p>

<p>Immediately after his return to Virginia
from this expedition, Colonel Washington
resigned his military commission. On the
6th of January, 1759, at the age of twenty-seven,
he married Martha Custis, the widow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of Daniel Parke Custis, and daughter of
John Dandridge. Colonel Washington,
though absent at the time, was elected a
member of the Virginia Assembly by a
large majority over three active rival candidates.
He attended the session of the
Assembly held in the month of February.
The house had resolved, without the
knowledge of Washington, to return their
thanks to him in a public manner for the
distinguished services he had rendered his
country. This duty devolved on Mr.
Robinson, the Speaker. As soon as Colonel
Washington took his seat, the Speaker, following
the impulse of his feelings, discharged
the duty assigned him with dignity,
but with such warmth and strength of expression
as entirely confounded the young
hero. He rose to express his acknowledgments
for the honor done him, but such was
his trepidation and confusion that he could
not give distinct utterance to a single sentence.
He blushed, stammered and trembled
for a moment, when the Speaker relieved
him by a stroke of address that would
have done honor to Louis the Eighteenth
in his proudest and happiest moment. “Sit
down, Colonel Washington,” said he, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a conciliating smile, “your modesty is equal
to your valor; and that surpasses the power
of any language that I possess.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>When the session closed, the Colonel repaired,
with Mrs. Washington, to his residence
at Mount Vernon. Here he enjoyed
the pleasures of domestic life and his favorite
agricultural occupations for sixteen
years, until called by the voice of his
country to take command of the American
armies at the commencement of the war of
the Revolution. He cultivated and improved
his lands with remarkable judgment.
He conducted his business upon a regular
system. Economy was observed through
every department of it. His accounts were
inspected weekly. The divisions of his
farm were numbered, an exact account was
kept of the produce of each lot together with
the expense of cultivating it, so that the
profit or loss of any crop as well as the
relative advantages of different modes of
husbandry might be seen at one view.</p>

<p>During Washington’s retreat from military
life he was a magistrate of the county in
which he resided, and frequently a member
of the Virginia Legislature. He was hospitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and charitable; a friend to the church
in the parish where he lived, and ever ready
to do all in his power to promote the interests
of morality and religion. He was indeed
a friend of his country and a friend of mankind.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>
</div>


<p>The first Congress of the United Colonies met at
Philadelphia in 1774. Washington was a leading
member of that body, and took an active part in opposition
to the principles assumed by the then British
administration and parliament in relation to the American
colonies.</p>

<p>He was unanimously elected by Congress, General
and Commander-in-chief of the United Colonies and
of all their forces. When the President of Congress
communicated this election, Washington thus addressed
him:</p>

<p>“Mr. President—Although I am truly sensible of the
high honor done me by this appointment, I feel a consciousness
that my abilities and military experience
may not be equal to the extensive trust. However, as
the Congress desire it, I will enter upon the momentous
duty and exert every power I possess in their
service and in support of our glorious cause. I beg
they will accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished
testimony of their approbation.</p>

<p>“But unless some unlucky event should happen unfavorable
to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered
by every gentleman in the room that I this day
declare, with the utmost sincerity, I do not think myself
equal to the command with which I am honored.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
I beg leave, sir, to assure the Congress, that, as no pecuniary
consideration could have tempted me to accept
this arduous employment, at the expense of my domestic
ease and happiness, I do not wish to make any
profit from it. I will keep an exact account of my expenses.
These, I doubt not, the Congress will discharge,
and that is all I desire.”</p>

<p>Under what privations, difficulties and discouragements,
Washington led our fathers through their revolutionary
struggle, to victory and national independence,
is well known. His agency in establishing that
independence upon the basis of union in a national
constitution, and his excellent administration of the
government as the first President of the United States
under that constitution, is equally well known.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Washington was exactly six feet high. His limbs
were well formed and indicated strength. His eyes
were greyish, and his hair of a brown color. His complexion
was light, and his countenance serene and
thoughtful.</p>

<p>His manners were graceful, manly and dignified.
His general appearance never failed to engage the respect
and esteem of all who approached him. He possessed
the most perfect self-government, and in a remarkable
degree the faculty of hiding the weaknesses
inseparable from human nature. He ever bore his
distinguished honors with meekness and equanimity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Reserved but not haughty in his disposition, he was
accessible to all but he unbosomed himself only to his
confidential friends.</p>

<p>He was not so much distinguished for brilliancy of
intellect, as for industry of application, solidity of
judgment and consummate prudence of conduct. He
was not so eminent for any single quality as for a union
of great, amiable, and good qualities, rarely combined
in the same character.—<cite>Bancroft’s Life of Washington.</cite></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Stewart, the eminent portrait painter, used to
say there were features in the face of Washington, different
from any he had ever observed in any other
human being. The sockets for the eyes were larger
than he had ever met with before, and the upper part
of his nose broader.</p>

<p>He always spoke with great diffidence, and sometimes
hesitated for a word; but it was always to find one well
adapted to his meaning. His language was manly and
expressive.</p>

<p>Few persons ever found themselves for the first time
in the presence of Washington, without being impressed
with a degree of veneration and awe; nor did those
emotions subside on a closer acquaintance; on the contrary,
his person and deportment were such as tended
rather to augment them. The whole range of history
does not present to our view a character upon which
we can dwell with such entire and unmixed admiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The long life of Washington is unstained by a
single blot. He was indeed a man of such rare endowments,
and such a fortunate temperament, that every
action he performed was equally exempted from the
charge of vice or weakness. Whatever he said or
did, or wrote, was stamped with a striking and peculiar
propriety. His qualities were so happily blended and
so nicely harmonized, that the result was a great and
perfect whole. The passions of his mind and the dispositions
of his heart were admirably suited to each
other. His views, though liberal, were never extravagant.
His virtues, though comprehensive and beneficent,
were discriminating, judicious and practical.</p>

<p>Yet his character, though regular and uniform, possessed
none of the littleness which may sometimes belong
to these descriptions of men. It formed a majestic
pile, the effect of which was not impaired, but improved
by order and symmetry. There was nothing in it to
dazzle by wildness, and surprise by eccentricity. It
was of a higher species of moral beauty. It contained
every thing great and elevated, but it had no false and
tinsel ornament. It was not the model cried up by
fashion and circumstance: its excellence was adapted
to the true and just moral taste, incapable of change
from the varying accidents of manners, of opinions and
times. General Washington is not the idol of a day,
but the hero of ages!</p>

<p>Placed in circumstances of the most trying difficulty
at the commencement of the American contest, he accepted
that situation which was pre-eminent in danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and responsibility. His perseverance overcame every
obstacle; his moderation conciliated every opposition;
his genius supplied every resource; his enlarged views
could plan, revise, and improve every branch of civil
and military operation. He had the superior courage
which can act or can forbear to act, as policy dictates,
careless of the reproaches of ignorance either in power
or out of power. He knew how to conquer by waiting,
in spite of obloquy, for the moment of victory; and he
merited true praise by despising undeserved censure.
In the most arduous moments of the contest, his prudent
firmness proved the salvation of the cause which
he supported.</p>

<p>His conduct was, on all occasions, guided by the
most pure disinterestedness. Far superior to low and
grovelling motives, he seemed even to be uninfluenced
by that ambition which has justly been called the instinct
of great souls. He acted ever as if his country’s
welfare, and that alone, was the moving spring. His
excellent mind needed not even the stimulus of ambition,
or the prospect of fame. Glory was a secondary
consideration. He performed great actions; he persevered
in a course of laborious utility, with an equanimity
that neither sought distinction, nor was flattered
by it. His reward was in the consciousness of his own
rectitude, and in the success of his patriotic efforts.</p>

<p>As his elevation to the chief power was the unbiassed
choice of his countrymen, his exercise of it was agreeable
to the purity of its origin. As he had neither solicited
nor usurped dominion, he had neither to contend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
with the opposition of rivals, nor the revenge of enemies.
As his authority was undisputed, so it required
no jealous precautions, no rigorous severity. His government
was mild and gentle; it was beneficent and
liberal; it was wise and just. His prudent administration
consolidated and enlarged the dominion of an infant
republic. In voluntarily resigning the magistracy
which he had filled with such distinguished honor, he
enjoyed the unequalled satisfaction of leaving to the
state he had contributed to establish, the fruits of his
wisdom and the example of his virtues.</p>

<p>It is some consolation, amidst the violence of ambition
and the criminal thirst of power, of which so many
instances occur around us, to find a character whom it
is honorable to admire, and virtuous to imitate. A conqueror,
for the freedom of his country! a legislator, for
its security! a magistrate, for its happiness! His glories
were never sullied by those excesses into which
the highest qualities are apt to degenerate. With the
greatest virtues, he was exempt from the corresponding
vices. He was a man in whom the elements were so
mixed that “Nature might have stood up to all the
world” and owned him as her work. His fame, bounded
by no country, will be confined to no age. The
character of Washington, which his contemporaries
admire, will be transmitted to posterity; and the memory
of his virtues, will remain while patriotism and
virtue are esteemed among men.—<cite>From an English

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
